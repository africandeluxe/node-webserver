  <h1>Adana kebab</h1>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb ground lamb or beef</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground sumac (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, paprika, ground cumin, sumac (if using), cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>Divide the meat mixture into equal portions and shape them into long, thin sausage-like shapes around metal skewers. Press the meat firmly onto the skewers to ensure they hold their shape during grilling.</li>
    <li>Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Place the skewers on the grill and cook for 6-8 minutes per side, or until the meat is cooked through and nicely charred on the outside.</li>
    <li>Remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    <li>Serve the Adana kebabs hot with flatbread, rice, salad, and your favorite sauces or condiments.</li>
  </ol>
